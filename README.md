In this paper of Wireless sensor network (WSN), small sensor nodes are deployed which perform collaborative measurement process with short lifespan because of batteries that are used in sensors and so the energy must be conservatively utilized. We are using fuzzy logic to prolong the residual energy to increase the network lifetime of wireless heterogeneous sensor networks (WHSNs), it upgrades already existing Stable Election Protocol (SEP) by using fuzzy logic interface system which smartly assigns chances of each and every node to become Cluster Head (CH) which leads to energy efficiency in WHSNs. The fuzzy logic system includes two different Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) one for normal nodes and another one for advance node which include two linguistic variables, respectively. Firstly, the residual energy of each node and secondly, distance of each node to Base Station (BS). Simulation results show that proposed Fuzzy Stable Election Protocol (FSEP) is having the better lifespan than existing Stable Election Protocol (SEP).
